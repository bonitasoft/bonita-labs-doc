# Security

## REST APIs

REST APIs are secured using HTTPS and a JWT token.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch access should be restricted to the BICI backend. Alternativly you can use Elasticsearch editions that contains security features [see Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-security.html).

## REST API extensions

REST API extensions should be secured using Bonita REST API authorization mechanism [see Bonita platform documentation](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/7.6/rest-api-authorization).
