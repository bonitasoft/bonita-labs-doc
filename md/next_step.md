# Next steps

Future versions of BICI should focus on the following features:

## Business data in the algorithm

In order to have more relevant predictions on process which duration are more correlated to the business data, BICI should take in account some or all business data of these process.

## Several algorithms

The first version handles only one kind of prediction algorithm. In some cases, it could be more relevant to have different kinds of algorithms depending on the process. BICI should let the user choose and configure the algorithm by process.

## Predict case end flow

Right now BICI computes prediction about case duration. An other kind of prediction it does could be what kind of state the case will finish in. The case could have a successful outcome when finishing on a specific path or an error outcome when finishing on an other path.
