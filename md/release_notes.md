# New Monitoring 'Unknown' status

In BICI Monitoring page, a case who have a path with less than 100 cases passed doesn't have the 'On time' status anymore, but the new 'Unknown' status, in order to differentiate among the cases that are in time those who have a prediction and those who do not have one.
