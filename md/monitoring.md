# Monitor cases

The Operations Management Living Application contains pages that allow Operations Managers to monitor cases with more information that they could normally get by looking at cases execution.

## Monitoring page

The view is filtered by process and optionally process version.
The artificial intelligence algorithm applies to each case a prediction of how its likelihood to finish within the target duration.
Based on this information, the page shows a pie chart with the proportion of cases Late, Predicted late and On time.
This helps Operations Managers to make the best short-term decision to put operations on track if needed.

It also contains a list of cases that displays the chances for each case to reach the target duration, according to its execution so far and the time remaining before the target duration. This remaining time is also displayed for each case.

You can click on a particular case to display its overview.
