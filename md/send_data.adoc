= Send us (anonymous) data !

To be able to have better predictions we need to have real world data.

These data can help us try out and test new version of our algorithm. It means also that in later version of the modules there is higher chances that the prediction made but the module fit your own processes.

If you are willing to help us in that way follow that procedure given in https://community.bonitasoft.com/blog/data-science-applied-bpm[this blog post].
