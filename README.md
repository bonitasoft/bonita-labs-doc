# Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement documentation resources

This repository contains Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement documentation site content.
It uses AsciiDoctor and Antora to create documentation content.


## Notes about branches in this repository

Branches named `1.x` were used by a former documentation site when BICI versions where available.

We now document only a single version and the documentation sources are now stored in the `master` branch.
