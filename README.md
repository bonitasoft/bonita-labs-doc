This repository contains Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement documentation site content.
It uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) to create documentation content.


## View rendered content on GitHub

Using the [Github Markdown Format](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) allows to check the documentation directly on the GitHub repository website.

Hence a simple way to view documentation content is to browse the `md` folder on [GitHub website](md).

This [Table of contents](md/taxonomy.md) is also provided to ease your navigation.

## Build project

The project contains several tasks to generate the documentation content.

### HTML

Use `npm run build` to have the HTML files generated to the `build/html` directory.

This command requires 2 arguments:
- `version` - Documentation version string. Example: `1.0`. If no version argument is provided, then version is read from the `scripts/variables.json` file.
- `application` - URL prefix when serving documentation images. Image URLs will be like:
```html
<img src="${application}/images/${version}/<image_filename>"/>
```

**Example**: With version=`1.0` and application=`bcd`, generated HTML will contain `img` tags like:
```html
<img src="bcd/images/1.0/bcd_overview.png"/>
```

Providing arguments to the HTML build command is done with one of the following syntaxes:
```bash
npm run build -- [application] [version]
npm run build -- -a [application] -v [version]
npm run build -- -a [application]
```

Examples:
```bash
npm run build -- ici 1.0
npm run build -- -a ici -v 1.0
npm run build -- -a ici
```

### Taxonomy

Once the HTML content has been generated, the `taxonomy.json` file can be generated from the `build/html/taxonomy.html` file.

Use the `npm run taxonomy` command to do so.
