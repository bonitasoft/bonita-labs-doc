The Labs Program has been created to experiment projects with a potential high value in the Digital Process Automation field.  

These projects are not fully part of the Bonita Platform, but they are proving a point and may make it into Bonita at some point.

They may use only Community values. To test such a project, contact community@bonitasoft.com.  

Or they may also use Enterprise values. If you are interested to test such a project, contact the Product Management team : product.management@bonitasoft.com.  

In this documentation, you will find information on our main Enterprise Lab project: Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement.
