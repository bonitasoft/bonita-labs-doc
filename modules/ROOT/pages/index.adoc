= Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement Add-on
:page-aliases: release_notes.adoc

Hello Planet *Mars*!

Monitor the duration of open cases, get help from an Artificial Intelligence algorithm providing the chances for each case to finish within a target duration, get all data to understand the lifecycle of a case, and follow the trends on the longer term thanks to the Analytics dashboards.

This Add-on is composed of a standalone application connected to Bonita Database, and two Living Applications: one for the Configuration of business elements and algorithm, and one for Operations Management.
