Bonita Intelligent Continuous Improvement (BICI) configuration instructions.

== Configure

=== Configure Profiles

You need to set up the Bonita Portal profile mapping for the profile `Configuration` and make sure Operations Managers are mapped to the provided profile `Process Manager`.
Moreover, for each process supervised by Operation Managers, the `Process Manager mapping` must also include the Operations Managers in order to display data of the processes in the `Operations Management` Living Application.

=== Synchronize data

In the xref:configure.adoc[Configure Living application]'s `Polling Status` tab, activate the synchronization to push your data into the BICI storage.

=== Configure processes

In the xref:configure.adoc[Configure Living application]'s `Configuration` tab, set target durations and create models for your processes.
